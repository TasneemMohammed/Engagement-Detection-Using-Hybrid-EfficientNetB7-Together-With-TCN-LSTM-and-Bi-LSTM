## Abstract:
Students engagement level detection in online e-learning has become a crucial problem due to the rapid advance of digitalization in education. In this paper, a novel Videos Recorded for Egyptian Students Engagement in E-learning (VRESEE) dataset is introduced for students engagement level detection in online e-learning. This dataset is based on an experiment conducted on a group of Egyptian college students by video recording them during online e-learning sessions. Each recorded video is labeled with a value from 0 to 3 representing the level of engagement of each student during the online session. Moreover, three new hybrid end-to-end deep learning models have been proposed for detecting student’s engagement level in an online e-learning video. These models are evaluated using the VRESEE dataset and also using a public Dataset for the Affective States in E-Environment (DAiSEE). The first proposed hybrid model uses EfficientNet B7 together with Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) and achieved an accuracy of 64.67% on DAiSEE and 81.14% on VRESEE. The second model uses a hybrid EfficientNet B7 along with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and reached an accuracy of 67.48% on DAiSEE and 93.99% on VRESEE. Finally, the third hybrid model uses EfficientNet B7 along with a Bidirectional LSTM and achieved an accuracy of 66.39% on DAiSEE and 94.47% on VRESEE. The results of the first, second and third proposed models outperform the results of currently existing models by 1.08%, 3.89%, and 2.8% respectively in students engagement level detection.

## Project Structure and Usage
This project was prepared to run on Colab

There are several steps:

#### 1- Prepare the dataset
   * separate_data_into_4_classes.ipynb file is used to prepare the dataset
   * The dataset is divided into four categories, each category in a separate folder
   * To use the same ipynb file with a different dataset (eg: VRESEE), you have to change these 5 variables with your required paths
     
     The 5 variables: csv_file, existing_path_prefix, new_path_prefix_0, new_path_prefix_1, new_path_prefix_2, new_path_prefix_3
   
#### 2- Augmentation
   * DAISEE-AugClass0&1.ipynb file is used to apply augmentation techniques to the class 0 and class1
   * You can use the same ipynb file with a different dataset (eg: VRESEE), by only changing the paths at the fourth cell
   
#### 3- Feature Extraction using EfficientNet B7

   * Change the paths to your ones
   
   a- For the DAiSEE dataset
    
   DAISEETrain-FeatureExtractionUsingEfficientNetB7.ipynb and DAISEEValidate&Test-FeatureExtractionUsingEfficientNetB7.ipynb files are used to extract the features from Train, validate, and Test splits of the DAiSEE dataset
  
   b- For the VRESEE dataset
   
   EgyptianTrain-FeatureExtractionUsingEfficientNetB7.ipynb and EgyptianValidate&Test-FeatureExtractionUsingEfficientNetB7.ipynb files are used to extract the features from Train, validate, and Test splits of the VRESEE dataset
      


#### 4- Train, test, and tune the models

   * Change the paths for all the following files to your ones
   * Load the spatial extracted features and train them to get the temporal information using
   
   a- For the DAiSEE dataset
   
   DAISEEEfficientNetB7TCN.ipynb, DAISEEEfficientNetB7lstm.ipynb, and DAISEEEfficientNetB7BiLSTM.ipynb for TCN, LSTM and Bi-LSTM respectively.
  
   b- For the VRESEE dataset
   
      Model 1 TCN => 
      Model 2 LSTM =>
      Model 3 Bi-LSTM =>
